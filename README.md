Decaf
=====

Decaf is a framework that implements convolutional neural networks, with the
goal of being efficient and flexible. It allows one to easily construct a
network in the form of an arbitrary Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and to
perform end-to-end training.

For more usage check out [the wiki](https://github.com/jaderberg/cpu-convnet/wiki).
